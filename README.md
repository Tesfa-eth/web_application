Rate my school provides ratings of universities and professors in developing countries. Users can search for colleges and professors and see their ratings. The overall ratings will be graphically and interactively displayed. Written evaluations will also be displayed in a nice card view. Users can post written feedback and these feedbacks can be upvoted and downvoted by other users. In order to rate or vote for/against rates, users have to register and log in. Moreover, users will be given badges like gold, silver, and platinum depending on their participation and their credibility.This will be measured based on how many times they rated and how many upvotes/downvotes they get. And there will be a verification feature where notable will be verified in which case they will have a special check mark on their name. The web app will also use a profanity check library or a machine learning model to check for abusive words before a user posts anything. Other users can also report in which case they can be blocked based on the approval of the adminstrator.
